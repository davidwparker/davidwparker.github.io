This is going to be my last "WordPress":http://wordpress.org/ blog post, and after that I'm moving to "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll.  I may eventually get around to making my own publishing system, but for right now I think that Jekyll does pretty much everything that I would want.

I don't know when I'll be doing this, but hopefully I'll get everything situated in the next couple of weeks.  I also plan on setting up some permanent redirects too, so the Internet doesn't break.
