h3(header). What is it?

The Mortgage Calculator enables you to see how much your monthly payment will be for a mortgage, given the number of years, amount of principal, and an interest rate.

It also enables you to see the break down of each monthly payment so you can see how much is paid toward principal and how much is paid toward interest. Additionally, you can click on a month row in order to see how much principal remains until the mortgage is paid off.

The mortgage calculator can also be used as a regular loan calculator.

This app is Ad-Free.
