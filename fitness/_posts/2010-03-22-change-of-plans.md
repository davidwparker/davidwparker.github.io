There are a few changes in my workout plans, but not any for my weight plan.

## What's Changed

Last week I decided that I wanted to do the "Slacker Half Marathon":http://www.slackerhalfmarathon.com/.  In total it's 13 miles, which is a longer distance than I've ever ran before at a single time in my life (even while I was in the Air Force).  It's also June 26th, which is the middle of when I was planning on starting to run.  Rather than waiting to train for the event at the last minute (and failing miserably on race day), I've started training for the event yesterday.  Obviously, this isn't going to help me gain weight, so I'm going to have to take in a lot more calories than I already am to maintain my weight plan.  I already have a running schedule provided by "Fit Soldiers":http://www.fitsoldiers.com/, so I'm using that as my training guide for running.  Additionally, I'm keeping my bulking routine the same.

## This Summer

In addition to training for the the Slacker Half Marathon and bulking up, I had forgotten just how beautiful Colorado is (I mean, really... what's wrong with me?  My banner is a picture of the Rocky Mountains for crying out loud).  So, I'll be doing a good bit of hiking as well as swimming and going to "Red Rocks":http://www.redrocksonline.com/ to workout there once the weather is consistently nice.

That's about it for my changes.  I'm really looking forward to this summer.  I'm already healthier now than I've ever been before, and I think that trend will continue through the summer.
