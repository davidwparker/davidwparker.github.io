## Note: Major LOST spoilers below

First of all, yes, I know that Lost ended in May 2010. I watched the Finale the night it ended. I didn't start watching Lost until 2009. I knew I wanted to watch it, and that I would most likely enjoy it. But I hate shows that make you wait week after week in order to enjoy the entire storyline and the cliffhangers and blah blah blah. So I timed it so I would only have to watch the final season (season 6) week-to-week. It was still annoying, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

Before I started watching Lost, one of the things that I heard was that Lost gave a lot of questions but never answered them. So I set out to write down each and every question that I came up with while watching the show, for each episode. I also set about writing down the answers to said questions, and which season they answered my question during. It was actually interesting to do. Below are all my thoughts on Lost, which I wrote down between 2009 and 2010 immediately after the finale.

* _? who are the Others? why are the Others so savage?_
* --2.5, that wasn't the Others, but the Others are still out there.
* _? what happens for real if the code is not input into the computer in the hatch?_
* --2.17, it goes into a 'Lockdown' mode and then...?
* --2.23, it goes into Lockdown mode and then the electromagnetic field is not discharged.  If the code is input, then it is discharged.  The plane crashed due to the code not being input in time.

* _? what did Locke see on the giant door things?_

* _? did Henry Gale do something to actually make the doors go up?_
* _? why didn't Henry Gale run away?_

* _? who is Henry Gale really?_
* --3.2, Ben and he's lived on the island his whole life.
* --3.20, Ben hasn't lived on the island his whole life.

#### &#42;&#42;2.18 &#42;&#42;&#42; Hurley
* --interesting that Libby is one of the patients at the same place Hurley is.

* --guesstimate 2.18, building a church
* --2.19, a church
* _? why did Henry Gale really come back?_

* --Rose knows that Locke couldn't walk before the crash.
* _? where has Michael been?_
* --2.22, captured by the Others.
* _? why/who is Michael running from?  If he's running from someone, why is he running with fire (they would see it!)_
* --2.22, he's been let go by the others, but it doesn't really explain why he would be collapsing.

#### &#42;&#42;2.20 &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; Ana Lucia
* --I can't believe that people are still:
* --1) walking through the jungle by themselves
* --2) opening the door to the vault w/HG when they're all alone
* --I can't believe Jack finally admitted to being wrong for once?
* _? why did Michael shoot Ana Lucia/himself???_
* --2.22, to free Henry Gale for the Others (he thinks they'll release his son)
* _? to free Henry Gale?  But by shooting himself, what does he get out of it?_
* --2.22, to free Henry Gale for the Others (he thinks they'll release his son)
* _? was Henry Gale really coming back to get Locke?  Or was he just lying?_

#### &#42;&#42;2.21 &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; Mr. Echo
* _? why are all the Dharma Initiative stations abandoned?_
* --Dharma Initiative station Pearl (5) watching all the other stations... the ?... hmmm
* _? in Pearl, was there someone there recently?  It looked as though there were some cigarettes or something there._
* _? in Pearl, where does the camera record to?_
* --3.5, perhaps the Flame?
* _? in Pearl, where does the slot/tube go?_
* --2.23, it goes to a random field somewhere

* _? what did the others promise Michael?_
* --2.22, they promised him that they would let Michael and Walt go free.

* --do we get to figure out/know Libby's story or is it insignificant?

#### &#42;2.22 &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; Michael(&#42;)
* --(&#42;) Michael's character/story is rather unbelievable.  As a father who has never really tried to get his son back, his desperate attempts to get him back now make no sense.  Why would he kill people and release an 'Other' thinking that the Others will be honest in returning Walt (after attempting to kill Michael before)?  This is just lame.  But the overall storyline is moving on, so I liked the overall episode.
* _? who are the Others really (Walt said they were lying about who they are)?_
* --4.X/5.X, they've been on the island (forever) protecting it from outsiders
* _? why are the Others interested in those four (Jack, Kate, Sawyer, and Hurley)?_
* --2.23, Hurley to go back to tell the others not to come after them
* --3.4, Jack to do surgery on someone (guesstimate)
* _? why are the Others making Walt take tests?  What tests?_
* _? what did the Other (black woman) mean when she asked if Walt could be multiple places at once?_

#### &#42;&#42;2.23 &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; Desmond
* --interesting that Desmond 'crashed' the plane onto the island. (Electromagnetic field)
* --interesting that the General that let Sayid go was the same guy that was in the hatch when Desmond was first there.
* --interesting that Desmond said that perhaps the experiment was on the ones in pearl (since the button was real)

* --significance in where the placed each person: Jack in a locked, dark room (in the aquarium/Hydra facility), Sawyer outside in a locked cage, and Kate in a bright room, not locked, and asked to take a shower?
* --The others appeared to live in nice little homes... why are they so hostile?
* _? what did Juliet mean when she said "that was a long time ago" in reference to the Dharma Initiative?_
* --5.X, the Dharma time for her was her present in S5, but she may have referenced the fact that she was there in the future (currently present)?
* _? who was that guy (Karl) locked in a cage across from Sawyer?_
* --3.23, someone who wanted to date Ben's daughter
* _? why was Karl locked up?_
* --3.23, he wanted to date Ben's daughter (and then she could get pregnant and die)
* _? what is going to happen for the next 2 weeks according to Ben (Henry Gale). it's going to be hell?_
* --3.2, they're apparently putting her and Sawyer to work

#### &#42;&#42;3.2 &#42;&#42;&#42; Sun/Jin

* _? why does Ben not care that Sayid found the fake camp?_
* _? what's up with Rousseau's daughter and Karl?_
* --3.23, they're kids and they 'love each other'
* _? is the communication thingy in Jack's cell really broken?  How is it that he's hearing all this stuff?_
* _? how did the Others get the communication (broadcast) of the regular people off the island (Red Sox winning World Series)_

* --Am I really expected to believe that people are STILL wandering the island alone?
* --Mr. Eko died

* --3.11, an other at the Flame (communications post), Mikhail.
* _? why does Juliet want Ben killed?  (What's the bigger story there?)_
* --3.7, I'm guessing that she really doesn't want him dead, but she just wants to leave the island (she's been there 3+ years)
* _? who was that 'being' Mr. Eko's brother?_
* --Hypothesis: The monster is able to take on shapes of bodies on the island... or perhaps even memories of others.

#### &#42;&#42;3.7 &#42;&#42;&#42; Juliet
* --So, Juliet is a fertility doctor.  And it appears she signed on to come to the island (though she probably didn't know the details) and she's now been told by Ben that she can leave (after 3+ years)
* --Ethan helped 'recruit' Juliet, which means he was both on and off the island.
* _? why do the Others need/want fertility doctors?_

* _? why did the Others keep Mikhail over at the communication post?_
* _? why did Eye-Patch (Mikhail) shoot the Other girl?_

* --3.13, the Others promised Jack that they would let him go.
* _? if Locke knew about the C4, why did he really want to blow up the Flame?_
* --3.13, Locke doesn't really want to leave the island b/c it healed him and his dad isn't there/can't find him.  He believes that communicating with the outside world is 'cheating'
* _? who was the great man that brought Eye-Patch man (Mikhail) to the island if not Ben?_

* --what the~?
* --My guess is that there are now two parallel "worlds" going on... one where the bomb was successful and one where it wasn't.  My thoughts are that at some point, the two different timelines/worlds are going to meld into one, or at least they're going to have the same "ending" such that you can't "escape fate".

* NW
* _? how did Locke end up in the wheelchair?_
