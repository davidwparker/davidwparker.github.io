I've decided to use WordPress for my blogging needs.  As the "challenge":http://nubyonrails.com/articles/about-this-blog-memcached went out, I did indeed build myself a nice little blogging engine in Rails.  And when I say nice, I mean, working.  Also, when I say little, I mean very little.  I'll open source it soon.

The reason I decided to use WordPress is because I wanted to move this domain to Dreamhost from Slicehost.  Since I have a Dreamhost account that doesn't support Rails very well (it may now with Passenger), and I was constantly tweaking my Slicehost account, I wanted a place where I could publish regularly without bringing down my server.  As I also wanted to start sharing with others what I have learned technologically, whether it's Rails-related or not; I just wanted a consistent place to do so.  This is it.
