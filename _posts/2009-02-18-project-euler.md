Recently, I discovered a gem of a website: [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/).  Basically, the site has a bunch of mathematic/programming problems for people to solve.  The idea is great and it's an excellent way to learn how to program in a new language.  Though I'm sure most of the problems can be solved using a "pure math" methodology, they can equally be solved using a programming language.

My current goal is to become extremely familiar in JavaScript (beyond being a JQuery ninja), so I plan on solving one-two of these a week in JavaScript.  Perhaps later I will move on to other languages as well.  I'll be posting up my solutions to my blog here and you can also choose to watch my [github](http://www.github.com/davidwparker/project_euler) repository as well.  Of course I'm a bit late to the party again, so you may want to check out other peoples' solutions at [github](http://github.com/search?q=euler&type=Repositories&x=0&y=0) as well.
