I'm a huge fan of short title sequences. For me, it started with Lost, which really wasn't that great, but it was one of the first that I saw in that style. Since then, I've watched an assortment of other shows with short title sequences.

As of this posting, I couldn't find the intros online (youtube). I know that most are on Netflix, so perhaps I'll screen capture them sometime in the near future and put them here... until then, bear with me.

### Lost

The one that started it all for me. The sweet zoom.

### Heroes

So much potential (in the show). Why the eclipse? Pretty interesting.

### Daybreak

I like the idea of the repetition.

### Legend of the Seeker

Pretty boring sequence. The sword looked too fake.

### Jericho

By far the best one- I love the use of morse code to share something about each episode.

### Kidnapped

Could have been used ala Flashforward to share a little of each episode.

### Flashforward

Interesting take, similar to Jericho, but pictures are always too revealing, or not good enough.

### No Ordinary Family

The house with the window open... meh.
