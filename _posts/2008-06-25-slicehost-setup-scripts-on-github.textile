My Slicehost account provided my first real "on-my-own" server, outside of work, where I was able to do whatever I want.  I've been using Ubuntu for a couple of years now, and while I know my way around my system, I've never completely automated anything.  At a minimum, I wanted a way to do a scratch install of all the major software that I wanted for my Slicehost account to get up-and-running with a Rails app (through nginx anyway).

I initially compiled a list of scripts from Slicehost's "tutorials":http://articles.slicehost.com/ last December.  They may need to be updated as I was extremely busy all Spring.  Anyway, they're pretty crude, but they may be useful for somebody out there.  You can get them all here at "Github":http://github.com/davidwparker/slicehost_scripts/tree/master.
