[My Job Went to India](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0976694018?tag=parker08-20) by Chad Fowler is a typical book written about things programmers do, and could do, in order to keep their job. While the advice seems pretty generic, I found the book to be very interesting, and they type of information given in the book is great to hear again-and-again. I don't know that it's worth buying, but it is definitely worth reading at least once.

The book is divided into 52 chapters, one for each piece of advice over 6 parts:

* Choosing Your Market
* Investing in Your Product
* Executing
* Marketing... Not Just for Suits
* Maintaining Your Edge
* If You Can't Beat 'em

I'll be covering what I felt were the best pieces of advice within each part.

## My Notes

### Choosing Your Market

* You can't afford to compete on price- research current technical skill demand.
* Learn a new programming language (with a different paradigm).
* Be a generalist (know a variety of things).
* Be a specialist (know one thing really well).
* Work with smart people (be the worst in the room and learn from everyone).
* Find a job you're actually passionate about.

### Investing in Your Product

* Understand business basics.
* Find a mentor.
* Be a mentor.
* Practice. Code all the time.
* Pick a project, and read it a like a book. Make notes, outline, critique, learn.
* Automate something.

### Executing

* Do your long tasks first.
* Have an accomplishment to report every day.
* Be where you're at- be present.
* Make your job fun.
* Learn to love maintenance.
* Projects are marathons, not sprints.
* Learn how to fail.

### Marketing... Not Just for Suits

* Perception is reality.
* Keep a development diary.
* Learn to type.
* Build your brand.

### Maintaining Your Edge

* Carve out weekly time to investigate the bleeding edge.
* Focus on doing, not on being done.
* Watch the alpha geeks.
* Pick a technology you hate most, and do a project in it.

### If You Can't Beat 'em

* Lead.
* Learn from open source.
* Think globally.
