So, here's a trivial little poll:
What is the biggest waste of time on the Internet for you?

* Wikipedia
* Youtube
* Random Googling
* Digg/Reddit
* Game sites (Flash-based/etc)
* Facebook/MySpace
* Blogs
* RSS feeds (to news, blogs, digg, etc)
* Other (Fill in the blank)

For me, it's probably RSS feeds, with a splash splash of Facebook and Wikipedia.  What's yours?
