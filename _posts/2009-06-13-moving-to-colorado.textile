I know that after I got back from Europe, I promised to update a few things on this site...  Well, Tyler and I are moving to Colorado on Monday (two days) and I've been super busy.  Once there, I'll be looking for a place to live.  Once we're moved in somewhere, and things get settled down, then you'll be hearing a lot more from me.  This is going to be a great year!
