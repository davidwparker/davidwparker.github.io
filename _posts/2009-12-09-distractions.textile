I've been rather busy lately with quite a few things:
# grad school essays
# family stuff (Thanksgiving, Christmas shopping)
# taking Tyler to fun "Denver":http://avalanche.nhl.com/ stuff

I've also been playing a lot with "Sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com/, "XMPP":http://xmpp.org/ ("xmpp4r":http://home.gna.org/xmpp4r/), and "jabber":http://www.jabber.org/

I plan on blogging about that soon, and what it takes to write a long-polling Ajax web app in Sinatra to talk with XMPP.  Later, I'll go on to write how to create your own chat system completely in the browser.  By the way, I have heard of "web sockets":http://www.kaazing.org/confluence/display/KAAZING/What+is+an+HTML+5+WebSocket and I'm super excited to ditch the long polling in favor of them.  But until they're in a little more broad use, I'll stick with my simple solution.

Gotta love the busy holiday season!
