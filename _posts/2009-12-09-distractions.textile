I've been rather busy lately with quite a few things:
# grad school essays
# family stuff (Thanksgiving, Christmas shopping)
# taking Tyler to fun "Denver":http://avalanche.nhl.com/ stuff

I've also been playing a lot with "Sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com/, "XMPP":http://xmpp.org/ ("xmpp4r":http://home.gna.org/xmpp4r/), and "jabber":http://www.jabber.org/

I plan on blogging about that soon, and what it takes to write a long-polling Ajax web app in Sinatra to talk with XMPP.  Later, I'll go on to write how to create your own chat system completely in the browser.

Gotta love the busy holiday season!
