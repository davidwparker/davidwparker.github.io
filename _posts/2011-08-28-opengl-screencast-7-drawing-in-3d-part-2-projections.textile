title:  "OpenGL screencast 7 - Drawing in 3D part 2 - Perspective and Orthogonal Projections and Cubes"
categories: [posts, opengl]

In this screencast, I discuss drawing cubes in 3D. More importantly, I cover perspective and orthogonal projections and discuss when you would want to use each.

Functions used include:
gluPerspective(), gluLookAt()

The code is available to download on "Github":https://github.com/davidwparker/opengl-screencasts-1
