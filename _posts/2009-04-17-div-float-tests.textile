Even though I've been doing web-related work for seven or eight years now, I still wouldn't consider myself a "CSS":http://www.csszengarden.com/ "master":http://meyerweb.com/.  But that doesn't mean it's not too late to start.

Anyway, I was having a bit of an issue dealing with floats, so I created a quick div float test html to help me figure out exactly what was going on.
