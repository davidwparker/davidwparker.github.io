So there's plenty of things that I would love to say, but of course I can't say them all.  So, instead, I'll just play catch up.

I've decided to not take any classes this semester.  For the past three semesters I took five math classes in the thought that I would like to apply for a PhD in Economics.  After really looking over my life, programs, and professions, I really just don't think this is the route that I would like to take.  So, that was that.  No more classes.  These past few semesters have been really busy and I really haven't had time to work on any of my [side projects](http://gist.github.com/6443).  Now, I can finally play catch up.

Now it comes to which side project I should be working on... I'm huge into time management, productivity, etc. but I still find myself searching for time and wasting time.  It's a love-hate cycle and I know we all have them.  So when I laid out my general interests and side projects, I began to think of which I should work first.  The good news is that I don't have to choose only [one](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2008/07/what-if-you-have-many-different-interests-and-cannot-commit-to-any-of-them/).

Anyway, so my interests include Ruby, Rails, Merb, DataMapper, jQuery, Erlang, Fuzed, Hpricot, CouchDB, Amazon EC2, etc... Hmmm, seems like all the cool kids are getting into Erlang these days.

Additionally, I'm going to use some of my free time to begin working out (regularly).  I already enjoy working out, but I don't really do it regularly.  So, we'll see how that goes.  Pictures to come (ooh la la).

Wish me luck in actually getting things done (tm).  Hopefully, this time next year, I'll have a wealth of knowledge of meaningless stuff, but I'll be enjoying it full-time.
