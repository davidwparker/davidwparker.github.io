IDEA:
"PhotoBooth" for the web (via WebGL, not using THREE.js or other libraries).

SOURCE CODE (mine):
--project.html
--js/project.js
--shaders/

USAGE:
* Easiest way: Start a python server:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
* go to: localhost:8000/project.html
* Click on the effects button
* Move through the different pages to view/select different effects
* Click on an effect to apply it
* Change the number of passes and RGB values as desired
* Click on the photo button to take a photo
* Click on the save button to save photo
* Click on the cam button to go back to cam (from photo)

COMPUTER:
* Only tested on Google Chrome.

TO DO:
X * Continue to add a bunch of distortion filters (bubble, etc).
X *** NOTE: I expect this to take the majority of my time as I would love to add a bunch of cool effects.

* Enable the ability to modify filters "on the fly"... For example, if there is a swirl effect, then I should be able to "move" the center of the swirl.

TIME ALLOTTED:
* Apply filters before taking a picture from the webcam.
* Apply filters after taking a picture from the webcam.
* Have the ability to add multiple effects at the same time (and in which order they are applied).
* Add multiple extra "effects" that would use cool edge detection algorithms
* -- What I'm thinking is that you could select a "hat" and the hat image would be overlaid on top of where your head is on the webcam.
* Be able to 'upload' pictures.
* Be able to share pictures to Facebook, Twitter, etc.
