    <p>This may take a little time to load (it's doing it now, trust me...)</p>
    <p>See <a href="#concept">concept</a> and <a href="#instructions">instructions</a> below</p>
    <canvas id="game" data-processing-sources="game.pde"></canvas>
    <h3 id="concept">Concept</h3>
    <p>You're a run of the mill chocolatier. But you want to make it big. You need to learn, adapt, and evolve, if you want to make the big $$$.</p>
    <h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
    <p>Select your ingredients from the ingredients area. You can select up to 6 (different) ingredients. Once you have selected your ingredients, press the -> button in the prep area.</p>
    <p>Next, turn on the stove and let it begin... then start making the next chocolate. Once a chocolate achieves temperature between 95 and 99, turn off the burner to let it begin tempering (this is lower than what you would do in real life).</p>
    <p>Once the temperature drops back down between 88 and 90 degrees, press the -> button for the corresponding stove to send it to the molds. Don't let it drop below 88 degrees or you'll have to reheat it back to 105!</p>
    <p>Sell off the chocolate once it's cooled in the mold and make serious $$$!</p>
    <h3 id="todo">Gameplay things I wanted TODO, but didn't have time</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Implement levels => actually, you know, evolve</li>
      <li>Implement tickets => patrons would ask for a specific type of chocolate and you had to make it in time</li>
      <li>Implement difficulty => different chocolates would be harder to make, based on your evolutionary chocolatier level</li>
      <li>Require user to stir in the chocolate and stir while tempering</li>
      <li>Buy/restock different ingredients based on the level</li>
      <li>Many, many more...</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="keyboard">Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
    <p>First click inside the canvas, then you can use keyboard shortcuts</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1-6: add corresponding top row item of chocolate</li>
      <li>QWERTY: add corresponding 2nd row item of ingredients</li>
      <li>ASDFGH: add corresponding 3rd row item of ingredients</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="bugs">Known Bugs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pressing a button and holding it continues to press the button. This results in error messages such as only one chocolate can be added, even though you only pressed a single chocolate.</li>
      <li>Deleting an ingredient from the prep board that isn't the last ingredient added may result in all ingredients after the one selected being deleted.</li>
      <li>The color of the chocolate in the stove and molds doesn't match the selected type.</li>
    </ul>
