<h2 class="header">{{page.header}}</h2>

I'm a Christian, software developer | programmer | engineer, and entrepreneur. <br /><br />

I'm happily married to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_and_language_pathology">Speech Pathologist</a>. She helps old people, which I think is awesome that she is able to improve others' lives. <br /><br />

I am currently a grad school student at the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/">University of Colorado</a> in Boulder. I'm a dual-degree student, studying for both a Masters of Science in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">Computer Science</a> and for a <a href="http://leeds.colorado.edu/mba">Masters of Business Administration</a> (MBA). <br /><br />

Most recently, I've been doing a lot of <a href="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a>, <a href="http://developer.android.com/">Android</a>, and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/">iOS</a> development. <br /><br />

In the realm of OpenGL, I've mostly been using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>. I have several screencasts on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/iamdavidwparker">Youtube</a> (and I am still adding more) and have several projects on <a href="https://github.com/davidwparker">Github</a>, including a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense">Tower Defense</a> game <a href="https://github.com/davidwparker/opengl-3defense">(code)</a>. <br /><br />

As far as Android goes, I have one app on the Market right now (<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.davidwparker.MortgageCalculator">Mortgage Calculator</a>). The current project I'm working on is a workout tracker. <br /><br />

I've done varied work with iOS, but have nothing in the App Store right now. The majority of my work has been with <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/">Cocos2d</a>, which is an excellent framework.  <br /><br />

In the past, I've worked coding a lot of <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>. <br /><br />

In the web world, I enjoy programming <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a>. I'm sure there are several other great frameworks to check out, but alas I have not had the time to explore them yet. <br /><br />

Further in the past, I've done a ton of programming in <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html">Java</a>, specifically <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/index.html">J2EE</a>. Glad to be away from J2EE, though I am now doing a good bit of Java with Android, which has been a lot of fun. <br /><br />

In the future, I really want to learn <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">JRuby</a>, <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, and <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>. <br /><br />
