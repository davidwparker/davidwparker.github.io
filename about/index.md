Last updated: 2/9/2014

I'm a Christian, software developer | programmer | engineer, and entrepreneur.

I'm happily married to a [Speech Pathologist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_and_language_pathology). She helps old people, which I think is awesome that she is able to improve others' lives.

I am currently the CTO and cofounder of the startup [Uvize](https://www.uvize.com), where I do full-stack developer. Most of my time developing [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org) and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).

Outside the startup, my main interests are [WebGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) and [Indie Game Development](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/).

In Spring 2013, I completed grad school at the [University of Colorado](http://www.colorado.edu/) in Boulder, with dual-degrees, with both a Masters of Science in [Computer Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) and a [Masters of Business Administration](http://leeds.colorado.edu/mba).

Previously, my recent interests were [OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org), [Android](http://developer.android.com/), and [iOS](http://developer.apple.com/) development.

In the realm of OpenGL, I've mostly used [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29). I have several screencasts on [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/iamdavidwparker) and have several projects on [Github](https://github.com/davidwparker), including a [Tower Defense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense) game [(code)](https://github.com/davidwparker/opengl-3defense).

As far as Android goes, I have two apps on the Market right now: [Mortgage Calculator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.davidwparker.MortgageCalculator) and [Ideal Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideallyapps.IdealTracker) (Workout Journal)).

I've done varied work with iOS, but have nothing in the App Store right now. The majority of my work has been with [Cocos2d](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/), which is an excellent framework.

In general, I love coding in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/), [Python](http://www.python.org/), and [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).

Further in the past, I've done a ton of programming in [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html), specifically [J2EE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/index.html). Glad to be away from J2EE, though I really don't mind doing Android development at all.

In the future, I really want to learn [Go](http://golang.org/), [Clojure](http://clojure.org/), [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/), and [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/). I think too many people use a magic hammer for all their work, instead of using the right tool for the job. And unless your name is Thor, you're not allowed to do that.
